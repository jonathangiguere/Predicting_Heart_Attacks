# Predicting_Heart_Attacks
Group project using R and CDC data to predict heart attacks based on health risk factors.  Exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, decision trees (random forest and bagged), logistic regression, and model evaluation.

## Motivation
I performed this project as part of a group for an intro to data science class at the George Washington University. The requirement for this project was to find a sizeable dataset and perform predictive modeling.  Our instructor allowed us to use any of the modeling techniques learned during the semester.  My group opted to use Classification Trees and Logistic Regression given that most of our variables were categorical.

## Data Source
The data for this project was found on the CDC's website: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2013.html.  BRFSS stands for Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and is essentially survey data gathered by calling households and cell phones across the country.

## Using the Files
- The .RData file shows the raw data used for the project.
- The .Rmd file shows all of my group's code and write-up.  This file can be downloaded and knitted to get the final output.
- The .html file is the knitted R-Markdown file.  Look at this if you are only interested in the output of the analysis.
